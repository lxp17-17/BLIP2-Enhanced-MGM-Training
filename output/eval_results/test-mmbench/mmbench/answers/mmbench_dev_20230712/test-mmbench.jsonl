Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Tucker timed each ride. Madelyn and Tucker calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.\nFigure: snowboarding down a hill.\nIdentify the question that Madelyn and Tucker's experiment can best answer.\nA.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nLaura and Isabella were making batches of concrete for a construction project. To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test.\nWhich of the following could Laura and Isabella's test show?\nA. if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry\nB. if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use", "text": "A", "options": ["if the concrete from each batch took the same amount of time to dry", "if a new batch of concrete was firm enough to use"], "option_char": ["A", "B"], "answer_id": "YvZFziXvxjuAB2Xu69rvUi", "model_id": "test-mmbench", "metadata": {}}

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\n\nArianna's brother thought that crushed ice would keep his soda cooler than whole ice cubes.\nTo test this idea, Arianna divided a large bottle of soda equally among six glasses. Arianna added five whole ice cubes to each of the first three glasses while her brother crushed five ice cubes into small pieces before adding them to each of the other three glasses. Ten minutes after all the ice had been added to the glasses, Arianna used a thermometer to measure the temperature of the soda in each glass.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.
